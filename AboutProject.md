# KontraMusicPlayer

It's a music player that can remoted by an android application. Like all other music players, it can play music, it has a listview
component acts like a playlist and this playlist can be saved whenever you liked (it has to be your in computer :P). You can open
any saved playlist has extension ".kpl" file.
When android app connected to desktop application it can pause and resume the music, change to next song and previous song, and
can do many other things i am planning to add for.

It's still in developing stage so if you can test it for me or find bugs for me i would be greatful. Thanks all!
